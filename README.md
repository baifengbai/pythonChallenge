HEY !
=====

these are the solution scripts of some challenges that I solved on
www.pythonchallenge.com

solution of level 0 is very easy (and if you can't solve that :P) and I solved
challenge 1 on python interpreter only so I'm not having script of that level
.. but I know what has to be done in that level

~~Level  2,3,4,5 solutions are complete ... and level 6 solution is not the
complete solution (still figuring out what more has to be done... its quite a
puzzle :) .. but they always are)~~ Done Yay ! after 3 years
